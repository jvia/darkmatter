Weekly Report Week 7

Meetings

We met at Tuesday at 10.00 am to review the previous weeks progress and discuss the goals for the following week. 

Review Of Week 6

We had a disappointing week during week 6 with little development being completed due to other work commitments and team members missing due to illness. Also parts of the project were in progress such as networking and scrolling. 
Goals for Week 7

We decided that the goals with the highest priority were the following:

. Fix Scrolling
. Familiarise with Latex and start writing final report.
.  Make a level loader
. Keep working on the networking

We apportioned these tasks up roughly between the team to work on in the following ways. 

Charlie- Work on the final report and creating a main menu for the game and catch up with admin
Yukun – Scrolling
Jeremiah- Networking


Progress during Week 7

Progress during week 7 has been good with Yukun fixing the scrolling issues and linking scrolling to the mouse wheel. Jeremiah has made very good progress with the networking and has created a level loader and designer and has designed a few levels. Charlie has produced admin and has started to work on the final report.  Jeremiah has also implemented the colour changes depending on whether the computer blobs are bigger or smaller than the player. Joss has fixed the music player on windows.
