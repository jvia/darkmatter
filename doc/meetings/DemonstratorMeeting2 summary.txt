Summary:

During this meeting we were given more precise instructions on when to submit the specification. We were told it had to be in for 12pm on subversion in pdf format. We also talked about our progress for the week, including pair programming and testing with maven. Kat approved of these measures. We also decided to drop scrum programming partly because of the roles that different people would have to take on made the process seem convaluted. We were told that creating user stories might be a helpful part of our developement process. 

Action decided upon:

All members: produce specification and upload to subversion.
