Summary:

During this meeting we introduced ourselves to Kat and pitched our idea of dark matter to her. Kat approved our idea and informed us of the basic scructure of the module and the importance of logs,subversion and team work. She also prompted us into choosing a team name! After a brief discussion about pokemon we settled on team "giant cow" because to quote Joss "one of the new pokemon looks just like a giant cow". The name was catchy yet suitably absurd and humorous so "Giant Cow Games" was born! We also asked Kat about the specification that is due in by the end of week two and it was suggested to us that we should not go into technical detail but give a more general idea of what our game will be about and the principles used to code it. We were also warned about pitfalls previous teams had had in splitting up components of the project arbitrarily and then meeting at a later date to merge sections, as this had no fail safe and often required a lot of extra work to integrate components. We also raised the issue of possibly using games libraries or other source code in the programming of the game. Kat siad she would look into this for us and let us know. Kat also indicated to us that pair programming was an excellent idea.

3pm on a thursday was set for the weekly meeting with kat. 


Action decided upon:

All members: research osmos and subversion, think about content for specification.
