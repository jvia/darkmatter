Week 1 (16/01) :-

Met with team (20/01) for first time and discussed ideas on multiple different genres / ideas in terms of the game we wanted to end up producing, settled on a single idea, discussing some of the problems that could occur when programming it. Presented our group idea to our Team Java Tutor - Kat - who approved, we selected a team name "Big Cow Games" 

Week 2 (24/01) :-

Met for our second team meeting (25/01), went through certain ideas pertaining to the class structure of the game, concluding that until we had more information on the networking aspect we shouldn't move forward too strongly with implementing a detailed class structure, but for the mean time should stick to experimentation with basic ideas. Sorted out a schedule for pairs programming between the four of us where we would program with one every other member of the team for an hour per week.

Week 3 (31/01) :-

Met for our third team meeting (01/02), discussed our planned pair programming for the week and what we intended to achieve for the end of the week so we could update to our next version release. Settled on myself and Jeremiah working on a Matter class which would be used as a wrapped for Ellipse2D objects to generate both NPC and Player Matter objects, whilst Charlie and Yukun were set to work on Physics (Specially Vectors and Motion).

Week 4 (07/02) :-

Met and discussed what goals we wanted to set ourselves for the week ahead, looked at the most pressing issues with our game and what would 'need' to be done soonest in order to have our fully functioning prototype by week six - this ended up being 'Egocentric view', 'Server/Client Networking capability', 'AI Matter class' and 'Ejecting matter from any angle relative to your Player Matter'. We divided up the work with me working on the Matter Ejection, Jeremiah on the Client/Server, Yukun on the Egocentric view and Charlie on the AI programming. I completed my project by Thursday and then switched to looking at experimentation with playing music using Java - looking at the plugin Jorvis.

Week 5 (14/02) :-

Rest of the team continued to work on their assignments from last week whilst I continued looking at playing Music within our game. Abandoned the Jorbis idea as the plugin was more trouble than it was worth so I used the Java API to build a trackplayer which would assign a DataLine then stream Audio from wave files to a user. Expanded this to a full Music Player which takes ArrayLists of names of tracks from the resource folder and plays them in order. Now beginning to work on integrating this into the DarkMatter class, and also developing a fade in/out for the tracks.

Week 6 (21/02) :-

Met on Tuesday, wasn't much to discuss other than continuing to work on what we've already been doing in the last 2 - 3 weeks.
