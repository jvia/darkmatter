Week 1 (16/01) :-

Met with team (20/01) for first time and discussed ideas on multiple different genres / ideas in terms of the game we wanted to end up producing, settled on a single idea, discussing some of the problems that could occur when programming it. Presented our group idea to our Team Java Tutor - Kat - who approved, we selected a team name "Big Cow Games" 

Week 2 (24/01) :-

Met for our second team meeting (25/01), went through certain ideas pertaining to the class structure of the game, concluding that until we had more information on the networking aspect we shouldn't move forward too strongly with implementing a detailed class structure, but for the mean time should stick to experimentation with basic ideas. Sorted out a schedule for pairs programming between the four of us where we would program with one every other member of the team for an hour per week.

Week 3 ( 31/01) :-

Met for our third team meeting (01/02), discussed our planned pair programming for the week and what we intended to achieve for the end of the week so we could update to our next version release. Settled on myself and Jeremiah working on a Matter class which would be used as a wrapped for Ellipse2D objects to generate both NPC and Player Matter objects, whilst Charlie and Yukun were set to work on Physics (Specially Vectors and Motion).
