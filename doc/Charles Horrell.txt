Week 1 Log

Met with team for the first time at 1pm on thursday. Made contact beforehand after the first team java lecture and arranged meeting for then. We appointed Joss as team leader and myself as team secrectary. I then got in touch with our demonstrator kat and organised our first meeting with her for 3pm in the student study room. Before hand in our first meeting we talked about many different ideas for our game.I also set up a facebook group for unnoficial communication between the teams and instant communication as we are all often on facebook! The main ones included a racing game, a tower defence style game and a variant of fruit ninja. However we decided that the outstanding idea was a variant of the physics game Osmos. Joss came up with the name "dark matter" which we all agreed was good. We then met with Kat to get our idea checked and it was approved we also came up the name for our team "Giant Cow Games". During this week I then purchased the game osmos and played around with to help figure out the game mechanics and interesting features from the game we could incorperate and then improve upon while added an original twist.

Week 2 Log

Met with team for the second time on tuesday at 10am. We talked more about how we were going to code the actual game and the software engineering principles we would employ. We decided that pair programming would be an efficient way of keeping the team cohesive and working together towards the same goal. I have drawn up a timetable of all our commitments to team java and have uploaded that to the repository. Jermiah instructed us how to use the repository and set up the trunk and maven projects. He also found a link to a few interesting articles on games programming which we read. I have also done admin activities this week including writing up summarys of the previous meetings and producing the timetable. We are planning to meet on the thursday to discuss the specification and make sure the team is on the same page.
