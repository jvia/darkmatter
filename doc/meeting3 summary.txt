Summary:

We decided to meet to discuss the impendind deadline for the specification and to make sure we were broadly on the same page regarding what to put in it. We also talked over software engineering principles that we were going to use including maven and testing. We also discussed the GUI and the possible methods of animating the dark matter. Yukin also showed the team a small model he had made with an object bouncing around a screen and interacting with the edges. We then created a sandbox in the subversion repository in which we could put experimental code to play around with. We decided on physics that would go into the game that included making the game universe frictionless to make the modelling easier and to replicate space.

Action to be taken: 

All members: Produce specification and submit to subversion.
