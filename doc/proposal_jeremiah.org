* Functionality

  - Mouse based control
    - one click shoots out a ratio of self to give certain speed
  - Absorb stars if large enough, burn up if not.
  - Compete with other dark matter for control of the universe.
  - Dark energy being with desire to conquer universe.
  - If *exact* same size, find a way to deal with it.

* GUI design

  - Java SWING; possibly port to OpenGL if time.
  - Full-screen
  - Need a menu (using escape?)
  - Scaling/black bar so all resolutions see the same thing
  - Colors indicate size
  - Images and rotation for animating the characters.

* Release Plan

  - Weekly release cycle: XP
  - Create a new tag every week
  - robust

* Software Engineering and Testing

  - XP
  - Pair Programming
  - jUnit
  - Maven: awesome for development!


* Networking

  - P2P would be nice
  - Client-Server easier so more likely
