* Week 01

  Met up with team for a few hours and brainstormed ideas. Settled on
  an exciting one and we also picked an exciting team name. Met with
  Kat and discussed the overview of the course.

  Setup the repository and created a maven project for our team. Setup
  maven with all of our project related information. Probably some
  more to add but not required.

* Week 02

  Had our weekly team meeting on Tuesday. Decided that we would meet
  up three times a week for pair programming. This way we all feel
  comfortable with all the code. 

  I spent some time this week coding a Sprite class and a
  SpriteFactory class. They both have unit tests to ensure that they
  work as intended. It will be good to move these two classes to their
  own package eventually that way we can enforce the fact that sprites
  must be created through the factory class.

  Met up again on Thursday and had a productive meeting. Discussed
  more of nitty-gritty details of our project. We also spent time
  locating resources to aid us in building our project.
