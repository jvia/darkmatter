* Week 06

  We had our weekly team meeting. It was quite short since we were all
  busy and had the game goals from the previous week.

  I spent about 4 hours playing around and trying to understand
  networking code. Other than that, this was a pretty unproductive
  week for me. My SSC assignment ended up eating all my time and I
  wasn't prepared for that.
  
* Week 07

  We had our weekly team meeting on Tuesday. We talked about the
  stalled progress of our game and what we were going to do to solve
  it. We decided on some new features to add which would help propel
  the game forward. 

  I spent a few hours on Tuesday trying to implement the networking
  for the game. It was mostly research and trying to understand the
  problem. I created some classes but had no success is getting the
  code to work.

  On Wednesday I took about 5 hours to create a level loader. Levels
  can be defined in external `lvl' files which are editable in a text
  editor. The game can then load these files, assign a blob to each
  player and load the state of the world.

  Spent another hour or so on Wednesday making the blobs change color
  depending on their size. Essentially, smaller blobs would be blue
  and larger blobs would be orange. This made it easier to tell when a
  player was larger or smaller than the other blobs.

  On Thursday I spent about 2 hours making a puzzle level and refining
  the level loader. Defining levels in a text editor in slow going so
  I may make a GUI level editor or procedurally generated levels if
  there is time. But this is not a priority.

  I also spent a few hours on Thursday in an attempt to make a form of
  absorbing inelastic collisions. I was able to get inelastic
  collisions working but it completely broke the absorption
  process. Unfortunately, I had to revert all this code. I look
  forward to trying it again because it is a critical feature of the
  game.

  On Sunday I finally got the networking to send data over the
  wire. This took about 6 hours from start to finish. I am currently
  trying to integrate it into the main game but there are some
  problems. I will have to sort those out. I believe it has something
  to do with my `elegant' approach to handling the game state. My
  intent was to use set union to deal with all duplicates created by
  the clients and the server. Unfortunately, updating an object on the
  client and sending it back up causes it to be ignored because the
  older object is already in the list. What this means when you play
  is that none of the blobs move because they can't replace their old
  object self with their update self. 
  
* Week 08

  Made an attempt at integrating the networking into the main game
  code on Monday. I spent about three hours trying to make it work. I
  ran ino problems because updte objects won't displace older version
  of the same object on the server. Because of that I spent some time
  brainstorming a new approach. Instead I will use a pure client
  server model where the sever does allthe computation and the clients
  simply peek in on the state pf the world.

  On Tuesday we had our weekly team meeting. As we approach the end of
  the project there are fewer tasks to do. Now we need to concentrate
  on writing and adding the finishing touches. I spent an hour and a
  half changing the game architecture to a client-server model. Some
  kinks need to be worked out but it should be done today.
  
* Week 09

  This week was spent polishing up the game. I also added some
  features to Yukun's level loader. Towards the end of the week, a
  networking bug cropped up which I haven't yet fixed. I spent about
  15 hours working this week.

* Week 10

  On Monday, I spent about 4 hours working on the game. I attempted to
  make some art but that failed miserably. I spent most of my time
  tracking down a networking bug that was causing problems every
  couple of games.

  Tuesday was spent fixing more code and making the
  presentation. Yukun and I stayed up until about 3 am fixing every
  last bug in our code that we could and making sure the game was as
  ready it was going to be. I also spent a number of hours preparing a
  presentation in LaTeX.

  On Wednesday morning, I met up with Yukun and we finished up some
  more game bugs. It was a close one, but we managed to get everything
  finished before our presentation.

  On Thursday, I began seriously writing the report. Charlie had
  completed far less than I had hoped he would, so I spent a few hours
  preparing the LaTeX document.

  The rest of the week was writing. I spent about 15 hours writing and
  researching our report. It was slow going to do everything in LaTeX
  but our report does look very nice.

* Week 11

  I spent the majority of time everyday this week writing the
  report. In total, I spent about 20 hours writing and revising the
  report. But it looks fantastic and I'm pretty sure I've found every
  error in the document so I am very pleased with myself.
