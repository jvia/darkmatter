\chapter{Validation and Testing}
\label{cha:validation}

Your applet is expected to be in good working order and do something
useful. This chapter is important, because it describes how you
assure yourself that that is the case.

\emph{Testing} is so you can be confident that the software is
robust and bug-free. What was your strategy for that? How did you
plan unit testing (for components) and integration testing (for the
whole applet)? How did the prototype fit in?

\emph{Validation} is to check that in the end the applet is useful
and pleasant to use. What was your strategy for that? Have you tried
it out with teachers or students? What kind of rolling validation
did you use for the evolutionary part (developing the GUI)?

Establish what your project can handle successfully, and what its
limitations are. Use meaningful examples, not lists of trivial
cases.
