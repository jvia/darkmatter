\begin{abstract}
  Games are an interesting experience for a software developer. They
  require vast amounts of effort to implement even the most trivial
  features. They're also unique because we can actually show our work
  to friends and family and get more than ``So?'' as a response. In
  fact, if done correctly, games can inspire excitement in others
  which makes them rewarding to work on.

  Our aim for the module was to extend the premise of an enjoyable
  physics-based game. The inspiration for our game was Osmos by
  Hemisphere Games \cite{osmos}. Osmos is a game with a simple idea:
  absorb motes smaller than you while avoiding motes large than
  you. This game is a casual game that is more about solving puzzles
  than being the quickest.

  We had the idea to change this casual gameplay into something more
  exciting. By making the game multiplayer, the time to carefully
  consider your options is gone. You must now absorb as much matter as
  you can before your opponent does. This game is also unique among
  many multiplayer games because the loss of one player does not
  entail the victory of the other. It is possible for everyone to
  lose!

  Completing the transformation is in the details. We threw away the
  ability to change the speed of time to focus on the competitive
  nature of the game. The goal of the game is to become huge. We
  wanted to create an experience that pressured players to accomplish
  this goal as fast as they could. As a final detail, we added some
  upbeat music instead of the slow, ethereal music of the original.

% However, in circumstances where it is appropriate to make direct use
% of the words of another person, those words should normally be
