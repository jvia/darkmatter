\label{cha:us}


\begin{description}
\item [Instructions] We should have a how to play section on the main
  menu as an option besides playing the game. So after the program
  initially starts up the user should be able to click on the how to
  play button and be given a set of instructions on how to play the
  game or possibly if we have the time to implement it a tutorial
  level.

\item [Single Player] We should have an option to play a randomized
  level with a single player and an AI player on a single
  machine. This could possibly be labeled as play random map.

\item [Campaign Mode] We should have an option to play through a set
  of pre designed levels produced by us and in un lockable order
  portraying the storyline we came up with in our specification and
  initial meetings.

\item [Networked Multiplayer] We should have the option on the main
  screen to play multiplayer game this should then allow the player to
  start up or connect to a client server run by the other player.

\item [Multiplayer Instructions] We should have a help section maybe
  contained or containing the how to play section that outlines
  exactly how to host or connect to a game.

\item [Quitting a Game] The user should be able to exit to a menu by
  pressing escape and then from there should have a button to exit
  Darkmatter.

\item [Full-Screen Gameplay] We should have a resizeable frame that
  scales up or down all the objects contained in it accordingly at the
  press of a button to allow for play in full screen and windowed
  mode.
