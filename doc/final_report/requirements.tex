\chapter{Requirements}
\label{cha:requirements}

You have been given only a very general set of requirements; hence
you have to formulate more specific and detailed user requirements
for the applet you chose to do and explain why you chose these
features. Explain your choices carefully (not just lists of bullet
points). Note that not everything about requirements in general is
relevant for this project (for instance, you need not write much
about the hardware requirements, as they are trivial for this
project).
