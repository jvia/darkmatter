\label{cha:design}

This section is crucial. Describe the overall structure of your
program at a suitably high level of abstraction. For instance, UML
diagrams or informal box-and-arrow diagrams can be used to describe
program structure. Be sure to describe the MVC structure used. Note
that code listings or screenshots are not appropriate here. An
important point is how you have divided the project into modules
that different team members can work on, and how these are then
integrated. For example, you could use interfaces to describe a
clean boundary between modules, so that some team members use the
functionality provided by the interface, while another team member
implements it. Bear in mind Software Engineering principles of good
design like coherence and coupling.
