Summary:

We met for the second time to discuss coding practices and the sctructure of our game. We decided that we would leave the start of coding till week 3 when we knew how to work sockets and networking into the code as we felt that this would impact our code at every level. We dedcided on a pair programming schedule where we would each code with each other member of the team for an hour a week. We also decided that we would have this meeting every week. After these discussions and some discussion of the physics engine we decided to head to the labs to get subervision working and test it out. Jeremiah helped the team with this as he has prior expierience of using subversion. 

Action to be taken: 

All members: research coding structure and osmos, submit progress logs to subversion.

Charlie: Produce timetable of pair programming and other team java commitments and upload to subversion.
